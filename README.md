- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rev-enge

This useraccount is especially created to host/publish all kinds of reverse engineered PCB's and electronic circuits (or parts of it).
The purpose of publishing is to help electronic engineers to repair electronic devices and to keep electronic waste to a minimum.

The name rev-enge is more a shortcut to 'reverse engineering'.
Also 'revenge', as litteral to be taken as a sort of revenge towards manufacturers that do not want to repair stuff because of commerial (un)interest or of reasons "not economic to repair'.
In a lot of cases equipement can be repaired if you have enhough information or the schematics but most time these are not available.
